<p>The intervention of women in the course of the
world’s history has nearly always been attended
by those events upon which poets delight to
meditate: events of sinister and tragic significance,
the chief value of which is to show in rude
collision the ideals and the realities of life; the
common humanity of the central figures in direct
conflict with the inhuman march of circumstance;
and the processes through which these central
figures, like Lady Macbeth or Cleopatra, are made
to transcend all conventional morality, and, though
completely evil in the ordinary sense, to redeem
themselves and win our sympathy by a moment of
heroic fortitude, or of supreme and consuming
anguish. Such events and processes, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
belong properly to dramatic art; narrative
poetry, being of a smoother and easier texture
allowing more scope to the subjective play of
ideas: in short, it is more spiritual than real.
The Queen of Austrasia and Burgundy, whom I
have made the subject of my poem, is essentially
a figure of tragedy. Perhaps it might have
been better to treat her as a subject of dramatic
action; but in order to do so it would have been
necessary to limit her personality, to define her
character, to treat only a part of her various
and complex psychology. I preferred to show
her at the moment of complete renunciation, a
prisoner in her own castle of Orbe on the banks
of the lake of Neuchâtel, after she had been
betrayed by her own army, and had become the
prey of her own rebellious nobles; and the poem
is but a series of visions that come to her in
the stress of her final degradation, while she is
awaiting the brutal death which the victors
reserved for her. Indeed, so entirely spiritual
was my intention, I have scarcely thought it
worth while to enumerate the ironies of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
situation. The squalor of her cell, the triumph
of her foes, the prospect of her own immediate
death become entirely insignificant beside the
pageantry, the splendour, the romance of a past
which her memories evoke and clothe with faint,
reflected glories. She hears, in the charming
phrase of Renan, “les cloches d’une ville d’Is.”</p>

<p>In a note at the end of the volume I have
given some extracts from the <i>Histoire de France</i>,
edited by M. Ernest Lavisse, which show the
principal events of her life.</p>

<h1>THE VIGIL OF BRUNHILD</h1>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Brunhild, with worn face framed in withered hands,</div>
<div class="verse">Sate in her wounded royalty; and seemed</div>
<div class="verse">Like an old eagle, taken in the toils,</div>
<div class="verse">And fallen from the wide extended sway</div>
<div class="verse">Of her dominion, whence the eye looks down</div>
<div class="verse">On mountains shrunk to nothing, and the sea</div>
<div class="verse">Fretting in vain against its boundaries.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">She sate, with chin thrust forward, listening</div>
<div class="verse">To the loud shouting and the ring of swords</div>
<div class="verse">On shields, that sounded from the crowded hall;</div>
<div class="verse">Where all her ancient bards were emulous</div>
<div class="verse">In praise, now, of her foes who feasted there.</div>
<div class="verse">Her humid cell was strown with rotten straw,</div>
<div class="verse">A roost of owls, and haunt of bats; the wind</div>
<div class="verse">Blew the cold rain in, and made tremulous</div>
<div class="verse">The smoking flame, on which her eyes were set;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Her raiment was all torn, and stained with blood;</div>
<div class="verse">Her hair had fallen, and she heeded not:</div>
<div class="verse">She was alone and friendless, but her eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Held something kingly that could outfrown Fate.</div>
<div class="verse">Gray, haggard, wan, and yet with dignity,</div>
<div class="verse">Which had been beauty once, and now was age,</div>
<div class="verse">She sate in that foul cellar, as one sits</div>
<div class="verse">To whom life owes no further injury,</div>
<div class="verse">Whom no hopes cheat, and no despairs make pale;</div>
<div class="verse">Though in her heart, and on her rigid face,</div>
<div class="verse">Despair was throned in gaunt magnificence.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A sound disturbed her thought; she turned her head,</div>
<div class="verse">Waiting, while a strong hand unbarred the door,</div>
<div class="verse">With hatred burning in her tearless eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Ready to front her foes. The huge door gave</div>
<div class="verse">Creaking, unwillingly, to close again</div>
<div class="verse">Behind a priest, whose melancholy eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Were dropped before the anger of her own.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“A priest!” she cried; “they send to me a priest!</div>
<div class="verse">Mocking me, that my hand first helped these priests</div>
<div class="verse">Till a priest’s hand was strong to strike me down.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">He bent before her, swayed by grief and shame;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Then spoke: “Brunhild, they sent me not to thee;</div>
<div class="verse">But I came willingly, nor feared their wrath.</div>
<div class="verse">Arnulf and Pippin feast their warriors</div>
<div class="verse">In the high-raftered hall, and cheer the bards,</div>
<div class="verse">Who sing of how they smote thee: so I crept</div>
<div class="verse">Forth from the tumult. At the height of noon</div>
<div class="verse">To-morrow they will tie thee to a horse</div>
<div class="verse">That never has known bridle, to be dragged</div>
<div class="verse">Over the stony ways till thou art dead;</div>
<div class="verse">And I am come to shrive thee”: and he stayed</div>
<div class="verse">His tongue; but sorrow filled his frightened eyes.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Go from me,” then she said; “thou knowest how</div>
<div class="verse">My life has been as angry as a flame,</div>
<div class="verse">Consumed with its own passions. Go from me:</div>
<div class="verse">Thou couldst not bear the weight of all my sins.</div>
<div class="verse">Yea, go. I will not call upon thy God;</div>
<div class="verse">He is too far from me: could I again</div>
<div class="verse">Have my old strength and beauty, I should waste</div>
<div class="verse">Again the earth with my delight in war,</div>
<div class="verse">And vex my body with the restless loves</div>
<div class="verse">That my youth knew. A life of war and love;</div>
<div class="verse">Passions that shake the soul; bright, ruddy flames</div>
<div class="verse">Devouring speedily this fretful flesh:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<div class="verse">A life of clamour, shouting, dust and heat,</div>
<div class="verse">The tumult of the battle, ringing shields,</div>
<div class="verse">The hiss of sudden arrows through the air,</div>
<div class="verse">And drumming hoofs of horses in the mad</div>
<div class="verse">Thunderous fury of the charge, that breaks</div>
<div class="verse">Baffled, like waves upon a wall of steel:</div>
<div class="verse">Give me again that life of ecstasy</div>
<div class="verse">And I shall leave your heaven to its sleep.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">She wrapped her cloak about her, close; and frowned</div>
<div class="verse">Once more upon the flame. He spoke again:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“When I was long-haired, too, the windy joys</div>
<div class="verse">Of battle wrought a madness in my blood;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet never night came but mine eyes would close</div>
<div class="verse">On sleep, that seemed a mother to my soul,</div>
<div class="verse">In trustfulness as quiet as a child’s.</div>
<div class="verse">Hast thou no need of quiet, of a sleep</div>
<div class="verse">That stretches out its wings and shrouds thee close,</div>
<div class="verse">Healing thee of all wounds, and wards the day</div>
<div class="verse">Off from thine eyelids? There is peace in God,</div>
<div class="verse">If we might find him; but the way is far</div>
<div class="verse">And difficult of travel for our feet,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Leading through all the sounding ways of life</div>
<div class="verse">And silent ways of death, through whose domain</div>
<div class="verse">Each blind soul voyages in loneliness:</div>
<div class="verse">Nor ever has a man with undimmed eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Save he whom ravens fed, and he whose voice</div>
<div class="verse">Sounded the note of triumph, even in Hell,</div>
<div class="verse">While the dead flocked unto him, and the gates</div>
<div class="verse">Were lifted up for gladness, travelled it.</div>
<div class="verse">Wide regions filled with spirits numberless——”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">But Brunhild turned on him: “I see them now,</div>
<div class="verse">Though Death has not yet claimed me, in that flame;</div>
<div class="verse">And wouldst thou have me go to them in fear,</div>
<div class="verse">With loosened knees and face untaught to frown?</div>
<div class="verse">Would they for all my weeping pity me?</div>
<div class="verse">Yea, there is Fredegonde with mocking eyes:</div>
<div class="verse">I seem to see my life through smoking blood</div>
<div class="verse">That she and I have spilt in quarrelling.</div>
<div class="verse">Shall we too fill, with greater clamour, Hell;</div>
<div class="verse">Battling like eagles through the gloomy air,</div>
<div class="verse">That trembles at the passion of our wings?</div>
<div class="verse">Go from me: I repent not anything.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Nay, yet I shall not go; but rest and hear</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Thy story in the form it leaves thy lips;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor question thee, but bless thee and depart.</div>
<div class="verse">For surely all thy soul yearns backward now</div>
<div class="verse">To half remembered days, that fill the flame,</div>
<div class="verse">Even as you say, with floating memories,</div>
<div class="verse">Purged of the dross, that was a part of them,</div>
<div class="verse">Nought now but soft gold of thy plastic dreams,</div>
<div class="verse">Wrought to what shape you will: so have I heard</div>
<div class="verse">That we judge others and judge not ourselves</div>
<div class="verse">By a stern measure; and therefore we fail</div>
<div class="verse">Of perfect justice, which is charity.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Ye, who are sheltered from the world, O priest,”</div>
<div class="verse">Spake Brunhild, mocking him, “have time to pause</div>
<div class="verse">Ere your minds fix the measure of pure truth</div>
<div class="verse">And perfect justice; but our windy life</div>
<div class="verse">Loses no time on niceties: for me,</div>
<div class="verse">I gave such justice as I look for now;</div>
<div class="verse">I swung a hammer on mine enemies,</div>
<div class="verse">To forge the world anew unto my mind;</div>
<div class="verse">My cause was justice in mine eyes, and those</div>
<div class="verse">Who stood against me, enemies of God.</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! I have failed of all my purposes,</div>
<div class="verse">And age has come upon me like a cloud;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And these old shoulders groan beneath the shame,</div>
<div class="verse">The bitterness, the burden of defeat:</div>
<div class="verse">Yet I have seen the star, where others saw</div>
<div class="verse">Only the froth and spume of angry storms.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">He gazed on her with patient, gentle eyes;</div>
<div class="verse">Bowed, sate she, with her hands clasped round her knees,</div>
<div class="verse">Incarnate sorrow: then her lion’s head</div>
<div class="verse">She lifted; and spake once again to him:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“When I came out of Spain to Sigebert</div>
<div class="verse">The rude Franks wondered at my company,</div>
<div class="verse">My Moorish falconers and deep-voiced hounds,</div>
<div class="verse">My swift light-horsemen, harpers, lutanists;</div>
<div class="verse">And prophesied my days would fly, like gold</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the loose hands of a prodigal,</div>
<div class="verse">With the delight of hunting and the glad</div>
<div class="verse">Singing of minstrels in the crowded hall,</div>
<div class="verse">Where the red torches mirror on the shields</div>
<div class="verse">And burnished helmets their tempestuous lights:</div>
<div class="verse">Ominous fires of slaughter, flickering,</div>
<div class="verse">To flash out suddenly in angry flame.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“But, for a while, my house was filled with smiles;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And Love sate as a guest beside my hearth.</div>
<div class="verse">Each morning heard the horns call to the chase</div>
<div class="verse">The loud, glad music of the eager hounds,</div>
<div class="verse">While huntsmen cheered them onward, and the rides</div>
<div class="verse">Through woodlands, down the shadow-dappled ways,</div>
<div class="verse">Woke, in the answering April of my youth,</div>
<div class="verse">A pleasure that was one thing with the dawn.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“So passed my days, in courtly wise, until</div>
<div class="verse">Some whisper promised me another Spring</div>
<div class="verse">Thrilling within my body, and I felt</div>
<div class="verse">The first strange wakenings of motherhood,</div>
<div class="verse">The pledge, and prophecy, of future Kings.</div>
<div class="verse">And I went roaming through the woods no more;</div>
<div class="verse">Intent on quiet business with my maids,</div>
<div class="verse">Spinning new wool, or standing by the loom,</div>
<div class="verse">Or broidering toy baldricks, with gold thread,</div>
<div class="verse">Bright, to please baby eyes, that love bright things;</div>
<div class="verse">Dreaming on all the promise, that I held,</div>
<div class="verse">And all the storm and stress life held for him.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Then first I saw the doom that Nature laid</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<div class="verse">On women, to be careful harvesters;</div>
<div class="verse">To plan, and toil, and build for unborn sons,</div>
<div class="verse">To shape the future out of their own time.</div>
<div class="verse">These turbulent loud nobles with their feuds</div>
<div class="verse">Carousing nightly, or in companies</div>
<div class="verse">Changing their hunting-grounds from place to place,</div>
<div class="verse">Vexed me with their unthrift and wantonness:</div>
<div class="verse">I saw them as a hindrance to my son,</div>
<div class="verse">And pitted craft against their stubborn strength,</div>
<div class="verse">Fighting each step. They were dark, brooding days,</div>
<div class="verse">Heavy with sullen menace of a storm;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet found I friendly faces, in despite</div>
<div class="verse">Of much unbodied anger, for mine eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Held the soft light that tames the hearts of men.</div>
<div class="verse">Yea, and I roused them up with angry words</div>
<div class="verse">To ride with me for vengeance to the Court</div>
<div class="verse">Of Hilperik and Fredegonde, who slew</div>
<div class="verse">Galswith, the white-armed sister whom I loved,</div>
<div class="verse">The slim, fair sister with deep, dreaming eyes</div>
<div class="verse">As blue as harebells or calm waters are.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Ah! I remember that frost-silver dawn,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Clouded with curtains of deep-billowing mist</div>
<div class="verse">That rose to hide the first bright beams of day,</div>
<div class="verse">In a white froth, out of the wooded plains—</div>
<div class="verse">Delicate, wreathing, spiral broideries;</div>
<div class="verse">And how the hoofs rang loud upon the road,</div>
<div class="verse">Galloping o’er the drawbridge as if foes</div>
<div class="verse">Pressed close behind; the trembling messenger</div>
<div class="verse">Spent with hard riding, cold, and white with fear;</div>
<div class="verse">The steaming flanks and withers of the horse;</div>
<div class="verse">The soldiers pressing close to hear the news;</div>
<div class="verse">Sigebert, with his knotted veins, and hands</div>
<div class="verse">Fast-clenched, and anger flaming in his eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">As Galswith’s servant cried aloud to us:</div>
<div class="verse">‘Galswith is slain; Galswith, the Queen, is slain!’</div>
<div class="verse">And then, confusedly, as of a dream</div>
<div class="verse">Disordered, all the terror of the act</div>
<div class="verse">He built out of his words before mine eyes:</div>
<div class="verse">The sharp-cut shadows and the frosty light</div>
<div class="verse">Showing each angle of my battlements</div>
<div class="verse">And buttresses; and the light snow, that clung,</div>
<div class="verse">Frozen, against the cloister’s slender shafts,</div>
<div class="verse">Hanging them with light-splintering icicles:</div>
<div class="verse">How clearly can I see it! and the gleam</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Of scarlet and of steel against the snow;</div>
<div class="verse">And Galswith’s page, wild-eyed and tremulous,</div>
<div class="verse">Telling us how, as soft as evil dreams,</div>
<div class="verse">Hilperik and his harlot crept, by night,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the shadowy chamber where she lay,</div>
<div class="verse">Her sweet, frail body nestled close in sleep:</div>
<div class="verse">Sleep, that alone drove sorrow from her soul;</div>
<div class="verse">And he, the hairy hound, leaped on her bed,</div>
<div class="verse">Kneeling on those twin breasts of ivory,</div>
<div class="verse">And crushed the slender throat in his huge hands!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“I think I swayed a little; and I know</div>
<div class="verse">That something seemed to burn up all desire,</div>
<div class="verse">Leaving me rigid, filled with winter frosts:</div>
<div class="verse">For I remembered how, when we were young,</div>
<div class="verse">And shared one chamber in the donjon keep,</div>
<div class="verse">When she awoke, and felt the darkness, thick</div>
<div class="verse">And fearful, on her sunshine-loving eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">First she would call to me, and then, grown brave</div>
<div class="verse">At her own tongue’s sweet music, cross the floor</div>
<div class="verse">To creep into my bed, and cling to me,</div>
<div class="verse">Telling me how she dreamed that she was dead.</div>
<div class="verse">Think of that black and lustful ravening beast</div>
<div class="verse">Spoiling the slim white body! Sigebert</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Would have lit up the land with war that day;</div>
<div class="verse">But wisdom counselled patience. Bitterly</div>
<div class="verse">I waited. But my hate was like a hound</div>
<div class="verse">That, from afar, marks down his prey at dawn;</div>
<div class="verse">Though the chase last till evening, he keeps</div>
<div class="verse">His way through shadows, and the blazing noon,</div>
<div class="verse">Following, tireless, till his throat has blood.</div>
<div class="verse">Six years I waited, ere in armoured strength</div>
<div class="verse">I came to reap their harvests with my sword;</div>
<div class="verse">And hate to me was sweeter far than love.</div>
<div class="verse">O priest, was that hate sin?” He answered not</div>
<div class="verse">At once; but met her gaze with level eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Then answered: “Brunhild, thou must ask thy soul.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Perhaps she sought there, but no answer breathed</div>
<div class="verse">Her unmoved lips, close shut with a strange smile;</div>
<div class="verse">Then with a gesture, grave, magnificent,</div>
<div class="verse">She spoke again: “What fools have done to me,</div>
<div class="verse">Or enemies have planned; what shames and wounds</div>
<div class="verse">Arnulf and Pippin keep for me, or gave:</div>
<div class="verse">All that I do forgive. But answer, priest:</div>
<div class="verse">I, who wrought wisely through long weary years</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<div class="verse">To build a kingdom, where was turbulence,</div>
<div class="verse">And mould a civil state out of this strife,</div>
<div class="verse">Come at the last unto a shameful death;</div>
<div class="verse">While Fredegonde, who wrought for her own lust,</div>
<div class="verse">Died peacefully: has God been just to us?</div>
<div class="verse">Bow not thy head; bear with my bitterness:</div>
<div class="verse">Though God desert me in mine hour of need,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet shall I carry a firm heart to death;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor blame him, nor blame other than myself,</div>
<div class="verse">Who never trusted other. These six years</div>
<div class="verse">Of waiting over, Fredegonde and I</div>
<div class="verse">Began our war; she, breaking out of bounds,</div>
<div class="verse">And ravaging some parts of Aquitaine,</div>
<div class="verse">Till some barbarians from Germany</div>
<div class="verse">Came at the call of Sigebert, and slew</div>
<div class="verse">And pillaged all the people up to Chartres,</div>
<div class="verse">Turning aside to waste and burn the crops,</div>
<div class="verse">Ploughing the fertile land with war, until</div>
<div class="verse">Triumphant trumpets, through the startled night</div>
<div class="verse">Carried our menaces, upon the wind,</div>
<div class="verse">To Paris, safe among its flooded fields</div>
<div class="verse">Of reeds, and purple irises, and gold</div>
<div class="verse">Marsh-mallows, splendid in the light of noon.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<div class="verse indent1">“Three years our storm of vengeance shook the land</div>
<div class="verse">Ere Paris fell, and Sigebert in pomp</div>
<div class="verse">Rode through the gateways, proudly triumphing,</div>
<div class="verse">And bade me with our children follow him.</div>
<div class="verse">Hilperik fled to Tournai; and his host</div>
<div class="verse">Melted as snow in our sweet summer time.</div>
<div class="verse">How like a bride I felt again that day!</div>
<div class="verse">My little son beside me on his horse,</div>
<div class="verse">Carrying high that royal head of his</div>
<div class="verse">That the sun made more golden, smiled to see</div>
<div class="verse">Crowding about us all my husband’s men,</div>
<div class="verse">Who shouted as a welcome in mine ears:</div>
<div class="verse">‘Is Galswith now avenged? Have we done well?’</div>
<div class="verse">And the cry rippled on through all the ranks</div>
<div class="verse">While I smiled gladly on them; but my heart</div>
<div class="verse">Tormented me that Hilperik was fled,</div>
<div class="verse">And Fredegonde in sanctuary safe,</div>
<div class="verse">The church of God’s own mother sheltering her.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“How thick the people pressed to gaze on me</div>
<div class="verse">With sullen brows, or angry, wondering!</div>
<div class="verse">Till suddenly a voice cried musical—</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Lo, what a pearl Spain gave unto the world!</i></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Then, turning at the well-remembered words,</div>
<div class="verse">I saw, above the shifting, changing crowd,</div>
<div class="verse">The poet Fortunatus wave to me</div>
<div class="verse">From a high window, and his maddened eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Before the bending street hid him again.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“There is a doom on poets; their fond thought</div>
<div class="verse">Builds an ambitious phantasy, and calls</div>
<div class="verse">The frail thing Life; this gossamer of dreams</div>
<div class="verse">Each strong wind shatters. Priest, perchance it was</div>
<div class="verse">My beauty, like a wind, had wrecked his web,</div>
<div class="verse">So that his life became quite purposeless,</div>
<div class="verse">The whole world being alien to him,</div>
<div class="verse">And only I seemed to him like a star,</div>
<div class="verse">Beckoning him. Alas! his errant brain</div>
<div class="verse">Had clothed me, too, with grace that I had not,</div>
<div class="verse">And then misjudged me. Yea, I know the world</div>
<div class="verse">Imputes to me adultery and lust;</div>
<div class="verse">There is a doom on queens as well, it seems,</div>
<div class="verse">To have each action weighed by vulgar minds,</div>
<div class="verse">Criticized by the multitude; their names,</div>
<div class="verse">Toys, with which fools have grown familiar:</div>
<div class="verse">Yet who would waste denial on this mob</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Of idle chatterers whose souls are slime.</div>
<div class="verse">But, riding through this crowd, there came to me</div>
<div class="verse">A moment when I saw the hopelessness</div>
<div class="verse">In him, the hopelessness in all the world,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose praises are as crowns corruptible,</div>
<div class="verse">Born, as their worthless blame, of ignorance.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“I paused not long upon this wintry thought.</div>
<div class="verse">The world that I had won, before mine eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Broke into colour, motion, victory,</div>
<div class="verse">With banners breaking gay, and flashing steel</div>
<div class="verse">In serried ranks, as Sigebert rode close</div>
<div class="verse">To kiss me on the cheek, then drew our son</div>
<div class="verse">From the huge horse that proudly carried him,</div>
<div class="verse">To his own saddle-bow; and so they rode</div>
<div class="verse">Through all the army while I followed them.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The grave voice slackened from its pitch, and fell</div>
<div class="verse">Quavering, and the silence held them both.</div>
<div class="verse">Then Brunhild raised again her head and spoke</div>
<div class="verse">In a deep, even voice and passionless:</div>
<div class="verse">“The swallows of our summer soon were fled.</div>
<div class="verse">Sigebert left me with a slender guard</div>
<div class="verse">In Paris, and left Hildebert with me:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Then pressed on Tournai, after Hilperik,</div>
<div class="verse">Who fled before him on to Vitry, where</div>
<div class="verse">His nobles left him, laying down their arms,</div>
<div class="verse">Crying aloud: ‘Lo, we are spent with wars,</div>
<div class="verse">Let Sigebert be King of all the Franks.’</div>
<div class="verse">So the news came to me one warm eve when,</div>
<div class="verse">As the sun dropped behind the western hills,</div>
<div class="verse">I watched the bright stars one by one grow clear</div>
<div class="verse">In the green lingering of the faded light,</div>
<div class="verse">While swans came floating to me on the tide</div>
<div class="verse">Of the strong Seine, which royally they rode</div>
<div class="verse">With ruffled snowy plumage and arched necks</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the distance sailing, like a fleet,</div>
<div class="verse">And turned their course toward a reedy isle</div>
<div class="verse">Where each one preened its plumage till soft eve</div>
<div class="verse">With shuttered eyelids lulled them into sleep.</div>
<div class="verse">So, even as this isle unto the swans,</div>
<div class="verse">Peace seemed to me a welcome harbourage;</div>
<div class="verse">I counted now each step beyond clear gain</div>
<div class="verse">In the slow progress from our lawless state</div>
<div class="verse">To an imperial dominion set</div>
<div class="verse">Over the wreck of that old Roman power;</div>
<div class="verse">And all my thoughts were eagles carrying</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<div class="verse">The thunder of mine edicts through the world.</div>
<div class="verse">The folk of Paris, too, had heard the news</div>
<div class="verse">And gathered by the palace gate that night</div>
<div class="verse">To see me pass them; as I entered in</div>
<div class="verse">I thought their frowns had faded. Then I took</div>
<div class="verse">My way toward the room where Galswith died</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly, in that terror-stricken night,</div>
<div class="verse">To tell her that her kingdom now was mine,</div>
<div class="verse">If haply her pure spirit still might haunt</div>
<div class="verse">That mildewed chamber, stained and sanctified</div>
<div class="verse">By her own blood: but by the arras paused,</div>
<div class="verse">And through my tears looked on the little room</div>
<div class="verse">Where she had housed so meanly; and it was</div>
<div class="verse">To me the temple of her shame and wrongs.</div>
<div class="verse">Then that old lust for blood, unsatisfied,</div>
<div class="verse">Dried up the gentle sources of my tears,</div>
<div class="verse">And I turned back; nor thought to enter in</div>
<div class="verse">While Hilperik still lived, or Fredegonde.</div>
<div class="verse">Sleep fell upon mine eyes that night, as soft</div>
<div class="verse">As snow in April on half-opened buds</div>
<div class="verse">That usher in the many-coloured months,</div>
<div class="verse">Unvext by dim anxieties and fears</div>
<div class="verse">Of misadventures, which had troubled sleep</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<div class="verse">These many nights; and Hildebert, my son,</div>
<div class="verse">Slept the calm sleep of children by my side,</div>
<div class="verse">His sweet, warm body nestled close to mine,</div>
<div class="verse">Sharing the same enchanted realm of dreams.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Then seemed it as if rude and angry sounds</div>
<div class="verse">Rippled our visions, as a pebble thrown</div>
<div class="verse">In water blurs the cool reflections there,</div>
<div class="verse">Till growing louder, more tumultuous,</div>
<div class="verse">A rumour rose above the huddled roofs</div>
<div class="verse">That clustered round the palace, shattering</div>
<div class="verse">The crystal of our dreams, and then a voice</div>
<div class="verse">Shouted to me: ‘Brunhild, awake and fly!</div>
<div class="verse">For Sigebert is slain by treachery.</div>
<div class="verse">Even as we raised him on the kingly shield,</div>
<div class="verse">Fredegonde’s pages smote on either side</div>
<div class="verse">With poisoned daggers: all our strength dissolves</div>
<div class="verse">Into small companies of plunderers</div>
<div class="verse">Laden with spoil, their horses homeward turned.’</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“The harsh voice shuddered through the darkened room</div>
<div class="verse">Ere torches came, and in their ruddy light</div>
<div class="verse">I saw the angry eyes of Gondovald</div>
<div class="verse">Blazing before me with their baffled hate.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
<div class="verse">I trembled by the bed, but mine eyes too</div>
<div class="verse">Mirrored the angry torches. ‘Take the boy,’</div>
<div class="verse">I said to him: ‘I should but hinder you;</div>
<div class="verse">But leave me in the refuge of the church.’</div>
<div class="verse">There by the sleeping saints I sat and watched,</div>
<div class="verse">Fearing the dawn. So all my work was hurled</div>
<div class="verse">By ruinous chance to nothing in an hour.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Brunhild, not chance it was, but punishment:</div>
<div class="verse">The retribution followed on thy pride;</div>
<div class="verse">And on thy lust, and hunger for revenge.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">But Brunhild turned on him: “Would God destroy</div>
<div class="verse">A nation newly wakened into life,</div>
<div class="verse">Because of my one sin; and give the palm</div>
<div class="verse">Of victory to Fredegonde, whose life</div>
<div class="verse">Was sin in all its many changing forms?</div>
<div class="verse">How poor and futile are the sophistries</div>
<div class="verse">Of schools when one is drawing close to death,</div>
<div class="verse">That lies before us, silent, shadowy,</div>
<div class="verse">With veiled horizons and no guiding stars,</div>
<div class="verse">A vast, unfathomable, empty sea,</div>
<div class="verse">Broken by no white gleam of friendly sails,</div>
<div class="verse">Untravelled, claiming all our company,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<div class="verse">More secret than our wisdom may explore;</div>
<div class="verse">Into which darkness all of us must go.</div>
<div class="verse">I go untrammelled by mere selfishness,</div>
<div class="verse">Conscious that many hopes converged on me,</div>
<div class="verse">Till I became a symbol in men’s eyes;</div>
<div class="verse">And still more conscious of the silent strife</div>
<div class="verse">In mine own spirit when two courses lay</div>
<div class="verse">Before me, and a voice cried: ‘Choose the best!’</div>
<div class="verse">By what I choose now let my soul abide.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“One thing I learned, which is a part of hope</div>
<div class="verse">With me: God knows how willing is man’s soul,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet how his life is clouded o’er with doom,</div>
<div class="verse">And hindered by innumerable things;</div>
<div class="verse">So he will never judge by what I did,</div>
<div class="verse">But read my soul, and know thence what I was,</div>
<div class="verse">As no man knows me. Yet with tears I go;</div>
<div class="verse">For I have loved the green lap of the earth,</div>
<div class="verse">Its snowy toppling peaks with golden plumes</div>
<div class="verse">Of sunset, or with sullen clouds of storm;</div>
<div class="verse">Yea, I have loved the green fields of the earth,</div>
<div class="verse">And the gray fields of the eternal sea,</div>
<div class="verse">And night with its wide heavens, garlanded</div>
<div class="verse">With the innumerable stars, the moon,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Who sometimes like a blown sail in the sky,</div>
<div class="verse">Voyages, or enchants with gentle beams</div>
<div class="verse">Woodlands, and winding rivers, and still lakes.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“And I have loved the seasons in their turn:</div>
<div class="verse">Spring with her fragile flowers, virginal,</div>
<div class="verse">Laughing beneath her coverlet of snow;</div>
<div class="verse">Green Summer with her flocks of singing-birds,</div>
<div class="verse">Cuckoos, and nightingales, and shrill-voiced lark,</div>
<div class="verse">And swallows clamorous in crowded nests;</div>
<div class="verse">Wild Autumn with his wind-swept avenues</div>
<div class="verse">And fluttering of tawny golden leaves,</div>
<div class="verse">His late warm ripeness in the apple-trees,</div>
<div class="verse">The vagueness of his mourning, purple mists;</div>
<div class="verse">And Winter, finally, with amber lights,</div>
<div class="verse">His black boughs bare against the azure sky,</div>
<div class="verse">Or on a gentle, rounded slope of woods,</div>
<div class="verse">Clouded with purple bloom, his ivied trunks</div>
<div class="verse">From which the lone owl calls with his deep voice,</div>
<div class="verse">And, as the rooks pass homeward, overhead</div>
<div class="verse">The multitudinous murmuring of wings.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“All this I leave, and ways wherein my feet</div>
<div class="verse">Have grown familiar, to voyage out</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the darkness, void of any star.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<div class="verse">But in this little moment which is mine,</div>
<div class="verse">While all my foes are sleeping, drunkenly,</div>
<div class="verse">Among the dying lights, the broken meats,</div>
<div class="verse">Which the dogs tear upon the rush-strewn floor</div>
<div class="verse">While even the moonlight sleeps upon the hills,</div>
<div class="verse">I build again, out of my memories,</div>
<div class="verse">The storm and splendour of my troubled life.</div>
<div class="verse">Even the narrow frontiers of this cell</div>
<div class="verse">May in the crystal vision of the mind</div>
<div class="verse">Hold my remembered royalty, and keep</div>
<div class="verse">Dim memories of old magnificence,</div>
<div class="verse">Pomp, courtly festivals, and crowded days,</div>
<div class="verse">Of lovers who bent yearningly to me,</div>
<div class="verse">Of poets, who made music at my touch</div>
<div class="verse">As Memnon at the morning’s, of old kings</div>
<div class="verse">Grave with their wisdom, and young warriors</div>
<div class="verse">Whose wisdom was the lightness of their hearts;</div>
<div class="verse">These haunt my solitude, and pay me court,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor heed misfortune: but of all this state</div>
<div class="verse">Only one face is there which fills my soul</div>
<div class="verse">With some strong healing effluence, a grace</div>
<div class="verse">Of twilight reveries when all things seem</div>
<div class="verse">Merged in the peace of God, and we become</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Part of the clear, intense, eternal flame</div>
<div class="verse">Whose motion is like music, and we lose</div>
<div class="verse">Sense of ourselves in drawing close to God.</div>
<div class="verse">Love, that has cleansed the heart of pettiness,</div>
<div class="verse">Shows me the face of Merow in my dreams.”</div>
<div class="verse">And, as she spoke, the face of Brunhild lit</div>
<div class="verse">With radiance from that old love, her face</div>
<div class="verse">Softened, and age was as a grace to her.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Yea, I loved Sigebert; but all that love</div>
<div class="verse">Was but my childish wonder at the ways</div>
<div class="verse">Of men; and I clung close unto his strength.</div>
<div class="verse">Our friendship might have ripened slow like wine,</div>
<div class="verse">To be a cheer and comfort to our age,</div>
<div class="verse">Mellow with wisdom, tranquil, tolerant;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet is it but a shadow. Happiness</div>
<div class="verse">Is not the nurture of a steadfast soul;</div>
<div class="verse">But sorrow binds us with the bonds of love.</div>
<div class="verse">Love is a suffering, a sacrifice;</div>
<div class="verse">A hand put out toward all human pain;</div>
<div class="verse">A fellowship, through danger and the dark:</div>
<div class="verse">So was the love that Merow taught to me.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“The days of my delight had passed like wind</div>
<div class="verse">Over the water, and had died away;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<div class="verse">My lutanists and falconers were far;</div>
<div class="verse">And I sat lonely and a prisoner,</div>
<div class="verse">With Praetextatus, guarded carefully,</div>
<div class="verse">When Merow came to Rouen with a troop</div>
<div class="verse">Of young, light-hearted warriors, the close</div>
<div class="verse">Friends of his venturous youth and confidence.</div>
<div class="verse">How could he look on me with gentle eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Who had pursued his people like a hawk?</div>
<div class="verse">Yet then his mind turned back to Andovere,</div>
<div class="verse">Whom convent walls enclosed, and Fredegonde</div>
<div class="verse">Seemed now so hateful in his sight, he found</div>
<div class="verse">Companionship with me in hating her.</div>
<div class="verse">He, with his friends, all day would hunt the boar,</div>
<div class="verse">And the wild aurochs, but at night would sit</div>
<div class="verse">Close to the blazing logs, and there I served</div>
<div class="verse">The warm, spiced ale to them, or ruddy wine</div>
<div class="verse">From Macon, till I moved them, every one,</div>
<div class="verse">So that their eyes grew bright at my approach</div>
<div class="verse">And faded when I left them; thus it was.</div>
<div class="verse">But I and Merow had not yet drawn close</div>
<div class="verse">To one another; for when one advanced</div>
<div class="verse">The other tarried, so we vexed ourselves</div>
<div class="verse">With sudden heats, and sudden coldnesses,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Making each other sensitive and quick</div>
<div class="verse">In our resentment. Then one evening</div>
<div class="verse">There came a messenger from Fredegonde</div>
<div class="verse">To Merow, and he left our company,</div>
<div class="verse">So that I saw him not again that night;</div>
<div class="verse">And in the morning back to Fredegonde</div>
<div class="verse">Returned the messenger, but Merow went</div>
<div class="verse">Alone, and brooded much in solitude,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor heeded me, nor sought to speak with me,</div>
<div class="verse">As he was wont to on the least pretence.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“One morning to my room there came a page</div>
<div class="verse">Of Merow’s, who, when I would talk to him</div>
<div class="verse">At our chance meetings, blushed and hung his head,</div>
<div class="verse">But, when I heeded not his presence, gazed</div>
<div class="verse">Long on my face and fed his dreamings there.</div>
<div class="verse">He came to me by stealth, in secrecy,</div>
<div class="verse">And laid his hand upon my hand, and spake:</div>
<div class="verse">‘Brunhild, beware of Merow, for he thinks</div>
<div class="verse">To poison thee, and so to make his peace</div>
<div class="verse">With Fredegonde, who thus has tempted him.</div>
<div class="verse">And she has sent him poisons, which the art</div>
<div class="verse">Of Lapland sorcerers distilled for her,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<div class="verse">From herbs accurséd, in the moon’s eclipse,</div>
<div class="verse">Bidding him mix the draught into thy wine.</div>
<div class="verse">So, if he bids thee drink, drink not, but rest</div>
<div class="verse">Thy lips upon the rim, lest thou shouldst die.’</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Ah! how the sky seemed barren of all light</div>
<div class="verse">When the soft voice had finished whispering;</div>
<div class="verse">And my soul questioned me in weariness:</div>
<div class="verse">What plan or purpose was there left in life,</div>
<div class="verse">If my belovéd plotted death for me?</div>
<div class="verse">But yet I thanked the page, and let him kiss</div>
<div class="verse">My hand, and gave him a thick ring of gold,</div>
<div class="verse">And sent him from me ere I turned to weep.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Great bitterness was mine for many days:</div>
<div class="verse">Then one day in the cheerful, fire-lit hall,</div>
<div class="verse">When Merow and his company had come</div>
<div class="verse">Home from the chase, and feasted joyfully</div>
<div class="verse">While his hounds couched beside the glowing fire,</div>
<div class="verse">Merow, who had been sitting watching me,</div>
<div class="verse">Called for his horn, ringed several times with gold,</div>
<div class="verse">And filled it with the warm, spiced, foaming ale</div>
<div class="verse">From the great bowl; and filled a golden cup</div>
<div class="verse">Which Praetextatus out of Italy</div>
<div class="verse">Had brought, and given him, with the red wine;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Wrought all of gold this fair cup was, wherein</div>
<div class="verse">Were Danaë in the brazen tower shown,</div>
<div class="verse">And sweet Europa clinging to her Bull,</div>
<div class="verse">And Leda on a pleasant river-side</div>
<div class="verse">Crushing the lilies with her silver flank</div>
<div class="verse">While the Swan kissed her lips and fast-shut eyes;</div>
<div class="verse">This was the cup that Merow filled, and then</div>
<div class="verse">He came, and put it in my hands, and spoke:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“‘Thou fairest among women, whose bright eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Have lit for us these sunless winter days,</div>
<div class="verse">With radiant kindliness and gracious smiles</div>
<div class="verse">Cheering our weariness, though in thy heart</div>
<div class="verse">Sorrow for Sigebert still weeping lies:</div>
<div class="verse">How shall we render thanks for courtesy</div>
<div class="verse">When all our thanks would not outweigh one smile</div>
<div class="verse">That kindles in thine eyes, and curves thy lips</div>
<div class="verse">Upward, and lingers there deliciously,</div>
<div class="verse">Though the deep eyes have once again turned grave</div>
<div class="verse">With sorrow half remembered? O fair Queen,</div>
<div class="verse">Sprung of a kingly race, and not like her</div>
<div class="verse">Whose rule has been a curse unto this land,</div>
<div class="verse">A bastard peasant, spawned in infamy,</div>
<div class="verse">We pledge thee in our beakers: pledge thou us</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And if perchance, O Queen, thy widowed days</div>
<div class="verse">Pass wearily and sorrow sleep with thee</div>
<div class="verse">Ere youth has even ripened with the sun</div>
<div class="verse">In thy clear cheeks, then choose among us men;</div>
<div class="verse">For we are young, and hardy in the chase,</div>
<div class="verse">And foremost in the battle, and our limbs</div>
<div class="verse">Are straight and comely, and our eyes are bright</div>
<div class="verse">With health, and we have riches, all of us,</div>
<div class="verse">And all are noble, for our fathers rule</div>
<div class="verse">Over wide tracts of land and many folk,</div>
<div class="verse">In their strong castles; but this company</div>
<div class="verse">Have left the Court where sin and crime are crowned</div>
<div class="verse">To wander with me through this pleasant land,</div>
<div class="verse">Delighting in our minstrels and the chase:</div>
<div class="verse">Or if thou wilt not choose among us here,</div>
<div class="verse">Then pledge us in the cup, and so shall we</div>
<div class="verse">Depart hence, for thy beauty troubles us;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet shall we help thee into thine own land.’</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“He spoke, and they applauded; and I took</div>
<div class="verse">Out of his hand the curious wrought cup,</div>
<div class="verse">And looked toward the page, even he who came</div>
<div class="verse">That day to warn me, and he dropped his eyes</div>
<div class="verse">And shuddered; but I shuddered not. ‘O Prince,’</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<div class="verse">I answered him, ‘could all my words avail</div>
<div class="verse">To thank thee for thy kindliness to me,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet there would still remain within my heart</div>
<div class="verse">Thoughts too divine to rise in utterance,</div>
<div class="verse">Which even lovers’ tongues may never tell,</div>
<div class="verse">Though their hearts feel them, fluttering with wings.</div>
<div class="verse">I would some sleight of thine had filled the cup</div>
<div class="verse">With a love-potion, such as Iseult gave</div>
<div class="verse">To Tristram, while they journeyed to King Marc</div>
<div class="verse">In their beaked ship across the glooming sea,</div>
<div class="verse">And thou hadst tasted of it, ere my lips</div>
<div class="verse">Drank of the potent venom. But, O Prince,</div>
<div class="verse">No potion is there to increase my love:</div>
<div class="verse">Stronger it is than death, and deeper far</div>
<div class="verse">Than the blue depths of the untravelled sea.</div>
<div class="verse">Love fills me utterly, and is my blood;</div>
<div class="verse">So that, belovéd, hadst thou bade me drink</div>
<div class="verse">Of some death-working potion Fredegonde</div>
<div class="verse">Had learned from Lapland sorcerers to brew,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus would I drink it!’ and I drained the cup,</div>
<div class="verse">Then spoke once more: ‘Yea, even if one came</div>
<div class="verse">To warn me of the snare which she had laid,</div>
<div class="verse">And that thy heart consented to the deed,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<div class="verse">As one did come to me.’ ‘Brunhild!’ he cried;</div>
<div class="verse">And a loud cry arose from all his friends,</div>
<div class="verse">A sudden turmoil, suddenly to cease,</div>
<div class="verse">Leaving them mute, amazed. Then Merow spake:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“‘Queen, to thine hosts impute no treachery,</div>
<div class="verse">For Praetextatus and myself are free</div>
<div class="verse">From guilt in this though Fredegonde conspired:</div>
<div class="verse">Who said my heart consented lied to thee!</div>
<div class="verse">O Queen of the white hands and smiling eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">My heart is not a traitor to its love</div>
<div class="verse">To harbour evil thoughts against thy peace;</div>
<div class="verse">And ever since mine eyes first looked on thee</div>
<div class="verse">To see the wind lift from thy placid brows</div>
<div class="verse">A tendril of thine aureate, sunlit hair;</div>
<div class="verse">And ever since mine ears first heard thy voice</div>
<div class="verse">Fall through the darkness like a gleam of light,</div>
<div class="verse">Enchanting them with its swift wizardry;</div>
<div class="verse">And ever since I felt the gentle touch</div>
<div class="verse">Of thy hand laid upon my hand, which woke</div>
<div class="verse">And troubled the deep waters of my soul,—</div>
<div class="verse">My heart has been thy captive. O, my Queen,</div>
<div class="verse">Life was before me like a mystery</div>
<div class="verse">Filled with innumerable tongues of fear;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<div class="verse">But at thy touch I saw the world and life</div>
<div class="verse">Green with the promise of delightful days,</div>
<div class="verse">And like a harp of many twisted strings</div>
<div class="verse">My heart was, on which your white hand did play—</div>
<div class="verse">Or was it but the wind?—a melody</div>
<div class="verse">Awakening strange hopes and strong desires</div>
<div class="verse">And that old dream of beauty, triumphing</div>
<div class="verse">Within my soul, of how the world might come,</div>
<div class="verse">In time, to be a garden, such as was</div>
<div class="verse">Eden upon the hills, which first the dawn</div>
<div class="verse">Silvers, and broiders with her rosy veils:</div>
<div class="verse">Eden, where you and I were left, alone!</div>
<div class="verse">Ah, love, perchance our love might recreate</div>
<div class="verse">Again that garden walled from our desire!’</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“When he had ended, his strong hand was laid</div>
<div class="verse">On my slim hand, his fingers twined with mine,</div>
<div class="verse">His eyes fed on mine eyes; and thus we stood</div>
<div class="verse">Silent before his friends. As first one bough</div>
<div class="verse">Whispers unto his fellow, in the wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Who, soft, repeats to those who neighbour him</div>
<div class="verse">Until the wood is filled with whisperings,</div>
<div class="verse">So they unto each other whispered there.</div>
<div class="verse">But Merow led me silent from the hall</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Into the night, the company of stars</div>
<div class="verse">Innumerable, and of fragrant winds</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet with our secrets, murmuring delight....</div>
<div class="verse">How softly come these visions of the past!</div>
<div class="verse">Softly as shadows, or as glimmering sails</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the moonlit sea, or like shy fish</div>
<div class="verse">Through green translucent waters, to depart</div>
<div class="verse">In sudden swirls, while silver bubbles rise.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Next morning Praetextatus said a mass,</div>
<div class="verse">And laid my hand in Merow’s, his in mine,</div>
<div class="verse">Making us one.” She paused in sudden pain,</div>
<div class="verse">Bending her eyes down to the rotten straw,</div>
<div class="verse">While the priest watched her silent agony.</div>
<div class="verse">Then once again raised up her head and spake:</div>
<div class="verse">“What canst thou know of love, O loveless priest?</div>
<div class="verse">How comfort me for all which I have lost?</div>
<div class="verse">Nay then, bend not nor blush; my bitterness</div>
<div class="verse">Has made my tongue a whip, I see, to score</div>
<div class="verse">The poor weak body which is consecrate,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet sometimes turns from heaven, desiring earth.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">She ended, and the priest spake unto her,</div>
<div class="verse">Turning on her his melancholy eyes:</div>
<div class="verse">“Brunhild, I blame thee not for bitterness,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Nor that thy words have vexed my quiet soul</div>
<div class="verse">With passions that I thought asleep at last.</div>
<div class="verse">Suffering is a part of my desire;</div>
<div class="verse">It is a part of knowledge, and a part</div>
<div class="verse">Of that great human heart which calls on God</div>
<div class="verse">Because it is so comfortless on earth.</div>
<div class="verse">Rather I thank thee for awakening</div>
<div class="verse">Something within my soul that thrills with love</div>
<div class="verse">For that sweet human love which promises</div>
<div class="verse">The fluttering caress of children’s hands,</div>
<div class="verse">Their flute-like voices waking with the dawn,</div>
<div class="verse">The gaiety and laughter of their day.</div>
<div class="verse">But all these fleeting voices of our life,</div>
<div class="verse">The loves and sensual desires of earth,</div>
<div class="verse">Our joy in childhood, are but memories</div>
<div class="verse">Of innocence in sheltered Paradise,</div>
<div class="verse">Where in one music, flowering like flames,</div>
<div class="verse">They mix together, swelling symphonies</div>
<div class="verse">Celestial beyond our mortal ears.</div>
<div class="verse">So to me once there came a dream more fair</div>
<div class="verse">Of love unhindered by mortality</div>
<div class="verse">That veils us from each other, but which flowed,</div>
<div class="verse">Two souls in unison, as when two flames</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Meet, and are one, and have a common life.</div>
<div class="verse">Yea, my desire at last is one with God:</div>
<div class="verse">And children are his messengers on earth.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Then Brunhild answered him: “In the frail light,</div>
<div class="verse">I see so many children whom I bore:</div>
<div class="verse">But there are none of Merow’s children there;</div>
<div class="verse">Our marriage was a moment: and our sons</div>
<div class="verse">Were dreams we saw in one another’s eyes.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet if I speak of him my spirit feels,</div>
<div class="verse">Through the thin veils of flesh, the gentle touch</div>
<div class="verse">Of ghostly hands put out to comfort me:</div>
<div class="verse">Hands that were Merow’s, tremulous with love.</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! shall I speak to you of that calm dawn,</div>
<div class="verse">When we two rode together toward Tours,</div>
<div class="verse">Through woods but newly wakened into life?</div>
<div class="verse">The spring was laughing with her April eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Her fingers decked each bough with tender bloom</div>
<div class="verse">Of bud and blossom, and her feet awoke</div>
<div class="verse">The daisies, primroses, and violets,</div>
<div class="verse">While many birds, her swift-winged messengers,</div>
<div class="verse">Shrilled, from each dripping bough, her hymns of love,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
<div class="verse">In notes that chimed as sweet as rain on leaves;</div>
<div class="verse">And swallows hawked for flies above each pool,</div>
<div class="verse">That mirrored their light motion glassily.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Mile upon mile we rode, through wood and field,</div>
<div class="verse">High pastures where the shepherds tended sheep,</div>
<div class="verse">Counting the new-dropped lambs, and valleys green</div>
<div class="verse">Where hamlets sheltered, smoke-wreaths from each house</div>
<div class="verse">Curled upward slowly in the windless air,</div>
<div class="verse">And sparrows quarrelled on the well-thatched roofs,</div>
<div class="verse">Until at noon we found a sheltered spring,</div>
<div class="verse">In a small hollow under aspen trees.</div>
<div class="verse">Margined by reeds this mirror was, and gold</div>
<div class="verse">With mallows in the reeds, and smooth grass lay</div>
<div class="verse">About it, and the water bubbled clear</div>
<div class="verse">Out of a fissure where grew many ferns.</div>
<div class="verse">There, while the horses cropped the tender grass,</div>
<div class="verse">We sate together, and no word was said.</div>
<div class="verse">But on a sudden Merow took my hand</div>
<div class="verse">In his, and looked at me with pleading eyes.</div>
<div class="verse">I dropped my gaze, and silent plucked a flower.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<div class="verse">But ever closer drew that yearning face;</div>
<div class="verse">And his hand grew more amorous, his mouth</div>
<div class="verse">Closed upon mine; nor was I hard to win,</div>
<div class="verse">Wearied with my desire and love for him.</div>
<div class="verse">So the woods saw our wedlock, while the bees</div>
<div class="verse">Went murmuring about the white-starred grass,</div>
<div class="verse">At their sweet business, as we at ours;</div>
<div class="verse">Till Merow spake: ‘Dear heart, the night creeps on,</div>
<div class="verse">Hanging the distance with her silver mists,</div>
<div class="verse">And the swift-darting swallows leave the pool</div>
<div class="verse">Unrippled by their wings, while the quick bat</div>
<div class="verse">Haunts their deserted ways in flickering haste:</div>
<div class="verse">Come, let us journey onward now to Tours.</div>
<div class="verse">Is the way weary that is urged by love,</div>
<div class="verse">Love, who has shown us so delightful things?’</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“He raised me to the saddle, kissed the foot</div>
<div class="verse">He placed within the stirrup, and we rode,</div>
<div class="verse">Regretting that green harbourage of joy</div>
<div class="verse">Strown with its fragrant herbs. The moonlight played</div>
<div class="verse">Between the branches swaying overhead,</div>
<div class="verse">To throw fantastic shadows on the ground,</div>
<div class="verse">And the shy horses restive grew with fright</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<div class="verse">When a wolf howled, and fear pursued our feet.</div>
<div class="verse">Quietly rode we down the dusky ways;</div>
<div class="verse">Till Merow paused and listened, and we heard</div>
<div class="verse">Behind us, muffled, or ringing on the stones,</div>
<div class="verse">The beat of many hoofs. Ah! then we rode</div>
<div class="verse">With the keen sense of danger that is joy,</div>
<div class="verse">Galloping down the steep and stony path,</div>
<div class="verse">Abreast, where a false step would ruin all,</div>
<div class="verse">As if we played a game of chance with Fate;</div>
<div class="verse">And Merow smiled at me and I at him.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Soon the woods thinned where many trees lay felled,</div>
<div class="verse">And slopes of pasture rolled toward the Loire,</div>
<div class="verse">Enchanted with the moonlight; and we saw,</div>
<div class="verse">Black on the silver sky, the new-built tower</div>
<div class="verse">Of Tours unfinished, with its beacon fire.</div>
<div class="verse">But ever closer drew our enemies,</div>
<div class="verse">Till, on the level road toward the ford,</div>
<div class="verse">Merow and I gave our brave horses rein</div>
<div class="verse">And heard grow fainter the hoarse threats of those</div>
<div class="verse">Hired murderers, and won the goal at last,</div>
<div class="verse">Secure for night with wise old Gregory.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<div class="verse indent1">“Long after matins, in the carven choir,</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet with the scent of cedar, and the breath</div>
<div class="verse">Of incense lingering like a ghost of prayer,</div>
<div class="verse">Came Gregory, and spoke reproving me:</div>
<div class="verse">‘Brunhild, I know not whether temperate</div>
<div class="verse">The heart of woman ever is, but thine</div>
<div class="verse">Is all too quick, too passionate, untamed,</div>
<div class="verse">Too rash in the pursuit of its desire,</div>
<div class="verse">Too heedless of the motion of thy friends.</div>
<div class="verse">Fredegonde feared and hated thee, but force</div>
<div class="verse">Constrained her unto patience for a time:</div>
<div class="verse">Since Gondovald had threatened her with war</div>
<div class="verse">If she should harm thee, and her forces were</div>
<div class="verse">Disheartened, and the land weighed down with dearth,</div>
<div class="verse">Threatening famine if the harvest fail.</div>
<div class="verse">She saw her throne secure and ’stablished firm</div>
<div class="verse">As a sure heritage for her own son,</div>
<div class="verse">Contemptuous of Merow, whose light heart,</div>
<div class="verse">Unversed in intricate state subtilty,</div>
<div class="verse">Was pleasured most in roaming through the woods,</div>
<div class="verse">Or in an idle courtly dalliance</div>
<div class="verse">With lute-players and poets of his train;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Yet did she not intend that he should live</div>
<div class="verse">Longer than those ephemeral, fair things,</div>
<div class="verse">To whom the warmth of one delightful day,</div>
<div class="verse">And fragrance of the flowers, are all life:</div>
<div class="verse">When the time came she would be as a hawk</div>
<div class="verse">To rend the singing-bird she so despised.</div>
<div class="verse">Thou shouldst have fled alone to Gondovald,</div>
<div class="verse">And Merow, then, have followed thee by stealth;</div>
<div class="verse">But now the way is lost: thy passions ride</div>
<div class="verse">Full-armoured through restraint, though careful hands</div>
<div class="verse">And cunning might have lifted up the nets.</div>
<div class="verse">Thy flight with Merow fans into a flame</div>
<div class="verse">Passions of fear, dynastic jealousies.</div>
<div class="verse">Merow alone were nothing, but with thee</div>
<div class="verse">He is a danger in her path, a sword</div>
<div class="verse">To be encountered ere Lothair may sit</div>
<div class="verse">Throned above France.’ I rose and answered him:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“‘I have been blinded by the tears of Love,</div>
<div class="verse">Lulled into heavy slumber with his wine,</div>
<div class="verse">Till life slipped by me, fugitive as dreams,</div>
<div class="verse">While I lay drowned in an excess of joy,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Fed but unsated, and insatiable.</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! this interminable stress of life</div>
<div class="verse">Intruding on the splendid pageantry,</div>
<div class="verse">Wherein is decked the gaudy press of dreams,</div>
<div class="verse">That flatter love, as if another sense,</div>
<div class="verse">Imagination, showed us the true world.</div>
<div class="verse">I am but half a dreamer, and can shut</div>
<div class="verse">My purpose close unto the narrow view,</div>
<div class="verse">To seize the nearest opportunity,</div>
<div class="verse">Weaving it into this strange web of life,</div>
<div class="verse">As now I make the fate of Merow mine.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet am I compact of so many moods,</div>
<div class="verse">That a great yearning comes on me at times</div>
<div class="verse">For an illimitable night of stars,</div>
<div class="verse">Jewelling with their fire the purple vault</div>
<div class="verse">Of Heaven, wherein my soul would hang, alone,</div>
<div class="verse">Unconscious of this striving purposeless,</div>
<div class="verse">That vexes all our being; and anon</div>
<div class="verse">Comes, soft as flutes on an enchanted night,</div>
<div class="verse">The murmur of Life’s magic in mine ears.</div>
<div class="verse">The old cajoler and her henchman Love</div>
<div class="verse">Lure me into their arms again with spells,</div>
<div class="verse">That veil the infinite in warm desires,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Cloaks and dissimulations of her aim.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“‘So have I fed on dreams this month or more.</div>
<div class="verse">But a new motive quickens in my mind,</div>
<div class="verse">And all my old ambitions are astir;</div>
<div class="verse">Fredegonde day and night may toil and spin,</div>
<div class="verse">I am the fresher for that I have slept</div>
<div class="verse">If Gondovald may threaten her from Metz</div>
<div class="verse">With armies of my followers and friends,</div>
<div class="verse">Sworn to my service, may not I from here</div>
<div class="verse">Threaten as well and equally be heard?</div>
<div class="verse">And when her fear of armies is aroused,</div>
<div class="verse">May I not lull to sleep those other fears</div>
<div class="verse">Born of my love for Merow, telling her</div>
<div class="verse">That he was but a means to my escape.</div>
<div class="verse">Love never hindered her in the pursuit</div>
<div class="verse">Of her ambition; lovers are her dupes:</div>
<div class="verse">So let her judge of me. Merow will stay</div>
<div class="verse">In Tours with you, hiding his yellow hair</div>
<div class="verse">And simulated sorrow in a cowl,</div>
<div class="verse">Till I am firmly seated by my son.</div>
<div class="verse">Then let him come to me, and we shall weld</div>

<div class="verse">Lend me thy help in this, and I shall bless</div>
<div class="verse">Thy church and Rome with many precious gifts,</div>
<div class="verse">Spoiled of the conquered.’ And he answered me:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“‘Thou art a woman such as deserts breed:</div>
<div class="verse">A prophetess among the elect of God,</div>
<div class="verse">Who lays his mission on thee, with his hand,</div>
<div class="verse">As even once on Judith, and on Jael,</div>
<div class="verse">On Miriam, and Esther; such an one</div>
<div class="verse">As burns with all the strength and wrath of God,</div>
<div class="verse">Consumed with zeal, devoted unto death,</div>
<div class="verse">A sword of hatred to the impious.</div>
<div class="verse">Plough up this land again with bloody war;</div>
<div class="verse">And I shall bless thy work. A Herod sits</div>

<div class="verse">What matter if the ruin of the rain</div>

<div class="verse">And germinates with new luxuriance?</div>
<div class="verse">Let us not waste this night, but seek a means</div>
<div class="verse">To freedom for thee. Merow stays with me</div>
<div class="verse">Waiting until their vigilance be dulled,</div>
<div class="verse">And rusted by slow time; till idleness</div>
<div class="verse">Become a hunger after wanton sports;</div>
<div class="verse">Till I have lured them into vain delights</div>
<div class="verse">Of banqueting, and music, and the chase</div>
<div class="verse">After such game, or fierce or amorous,</div>
<div class="verse">As their lust shows them, perilously keen.</div>
<div class="verse">But, meanwhile, I shall send to Fredegonde</div>
<div class="verse">Two counsellors of subtile wit, to weave</div>
<div class="verse">Light snares about her so she feel them not,</div>
<div class="verse">Till, multiplied, they hold as fast as steel.’</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“So planned we in the shadowy dim aisles,</div>
<div class="verse">In confidence of time, as if it brought</div>
<div class="verse">Ever expected gifts and no defeat:</div>
<div class="verse">And ere another morn I fled, alone,</div>
<div class="verse">By unfrequented ways: and many years</div>
<div class="verse">Passed ere I looked on Gregory again.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">No motion made the priest as Brunhild paused;</div>
<div class="verse">His eyes avoided hers. She was as one</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Towering over the departed years,</div>
<div class="verse">The sea of years her memory like a shell</div>
<div class="verse">Held echoes of, and reminiscent sounds.</div>
<div class="verse">And above all her insults and disgrace,</div>
<div class="verse">The burden of her age, the bitter wrongs,</div>
<div class="verse">She rose into a calm, majestic realm,</div>
<div class="verse">That eagles might inhabit, with her mind</div>
<div class="verse">Intent upon the spectacle of life,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet heedless of her fate; no shame could touch</div>
<div class="verse">The soul that breathed in so serene an air,</div>
<div class="verse">Superior to mortal accidents.</div>
<div class="verse">But the priest felt that effluence from her</div>
<div class="verse">Shed a strange glory round the humid cell</div>
<div class="verse">And fill him with a fearful sense of fate:</div>
<div class="verse">The blind, remorseless progress of the world.</div>
<div class="verse">Sombre and threatening, her figure cut</div>
<div class="verse">Prow-like, and loomed through huge, tempestuous night,</div>
<div class="verse">Toward a doom obscure and imminent.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">She spoke again in slow and weary words:</div>

<div class="verse">The path he travelled, and next night would lie</div>
<div class="verse">On some lone upland underneath the stars.</div>
<div class="verse">While, as he wandered, drawing close to me,</div>
<div class="verse">I dreamed him still at Tours, and had no hope</div>
<div class="verse">To see him, for my lords were turbulent,</div>
<div class="verse">Grown headstrong in mine absence, and my son</div>
<div class="verse">Had not yet learned the art of governance:</div>
<div class="verse">To play on rival jealousies, and split</div>
<div class="verse">Alliances in factions; to dissolve</div>
<div class="verse">Confederacies, as an acid eats</div>
<div class="verse">Through base alloy of idols composite,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the whole crumble; to lead many weak</div>
<div class="verse">Against one strong, and win the name of Right,</div>
<div class="verse">Come in full arms to succour the distressed,</div>
<div class="verse">And break the bonds of tyranny; to pay</div>
<div class="verse">The world with phrases; lead the ductile mob,</div>
<div class="verse">Swayed by a momentary need, to ends</div>
<div class="verse">Imperial, that crown our finished work.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
<div class="verse">So wrought I with my proud rebellious lords,</div>
<div class="verse">Rousing the populace against their strength,</div>
<div class="verse">Sowing among them mutual distrust,</div>
<div class="verse">And fear, and drove them out with ruthless hands,</div>
<div class="verse">To herd with their own fellows, the lean wolves</div>
<div class="verse">Of winter, famishing, who bay in pack,</div>
<div class="verse">When the full moon hangs low, and golden grows,</div>
<div class="verse">Over the rim of the Atlantic waste.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“So swept I out my house and garnished it,</div>
<div class="verse">In preparation for the perfect guest,</div>
<div class="verse">Who comes on dove’s wings silently, nor thought</div>
<div class="verse">That one on sable wings, more silently,</div>
<div class="verse">Would enter in and take the seat of Love.</div>
<div class="verse">Rumour, that travels on each wanton wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Swifter than birds may fly, from tongue to tongue</div>
<div class="verse">Came laden with the news of violence wrought</div>
<div class="verse">In Rouen, by command of Fredegonde</div>
<div class="verse">On Praetextatus, the poor kindly priest,</div>
<div class="verse">Who took the ring from Merow for my hand,</div>
<div class="verse">And blessed the union that had been so brief.</div>
<div class="verse">Then there awoke in me that sense which feels</div>
<div class="verse">Strange intuitions of approaching doom,</div>
<div class="verse">And Fear crept through my dreams on stealthy feet,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Or crouched beside me, and the darkness seemed</div>
<div class="verse">Alive with evil; but I steeled my heart</div>
<div class="verse">To wait on time and all that time might bring</div>
<div class="verse">Of good or evil. Then from Gregory</div>
<div class="verse">Came messengers, who told of Merow’s flight,</div>
<div class="verse">And that the hounds of Fredegonde pursued</div>
<div class="verse">The fugitive through all frequented ways,</div>
<div class="verse">And forests, and waste places, and the lone</div>
<div class="verse">Bare mountains, sterile underneath the stars,</div>
<div class="verse">Yea, every valley, every hidden place,</div>
<div class="verse">Lest they should lose him, and the harlot queen</div>
<div class="verse">Avenge on them her seat grown insecure,</div>
<div class="verse">Through lack of vigilance. God, how the days</div>
<div class="verse">Lengthened their minutes into weary hours,</div>
<div class="verse">And weary hours to days! as if the time</div>
<div class="verse">Were frozen with the fear that gripped my heart,</div>
<div class="verse">And moved not onward to the destined end,</div>
<div class="verse">Ordained ere time. I could but send some men</div>
<div class="verse">Toward the frontier of her land and mine;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet some I trusted knew that to my love</div>
<div class="verse">There were no frontiers but that boundary</div>
<div class="verse">Between the quick and dead. They went in quest;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<div class="verse">I waited. And one night was borne to me,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon a litter, bloody and befouled,</div>
<div class="verse">The corpse of Merow carried shoulder-high</div>
<div class="verse">By mourning bearers; and I sat like stone,</div>
<div class="verse">Dumb, tearless, stricken by excess of tears</div>
<div class="verse">That would not weep, but lay congealed within</div>
<div class="verse">Mine overburdened heart. All night I sat</div>
<div class="verse">In silence, weeping not, until the stars</div>
<div class="verse">Were lost in dawn, until the silver dawn</div>
<div class="verse">Blossomed with splendour to a golden day;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet knew I not that day had come, for clouds</div>
<div class="verse">Covered the light of morning from mine eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Hid me in wells of darkness and thick night,</div>
<div class="verse">A Niobe of stone, but lacking tears</div>
<div class="verse">Which else had melted stone; till, fearfully,</div>
<div class="verse">My son came to me and put out his hand</div>
<div class="verse">And touched me gently; and, as in deep pools</div>
<div class="verse">One sees obscurely through the broken lights</div>
<div class="verse">And rippling shadows, so upon my sight,</div>
<div class="verse">Though faint and blurred, a vision of my son</div>
<div class="verse">Came to me, and I saw a shadowy crowd</div>
<div class="verse">Of crouching beings far behind my son,</div>
<div class="verse">As vague as ghosts, who filled the silent room;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And then I heard my voice as from afar,</div>
<div class="verse">Muffled in gloom, a voice that seemed not mine,</div>
<div class="verse">Bidding them leave me; and like ghosts they went:</div>
<div class="verse">All but my son, who knelt beside my chair</div>
<div class="verse">Sobbing out bitterly some broken words,</div>
<div class="verse">That held less comfort than his trembling hands.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Slowly there came to me the governance</div>
<div class="verse">Of limbs again, and from my chair I rose,</div>
<div class="verse">And went toward the litter where he lay,</div>
<div class="verse">The spoil of death, in ruined loveliness;</div>
<div class="verse">Breathless, whose breath had once made amorous</div>
<div class="verse">The night with music. And I touched his eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Which kindliness had closed with piteous hands</div>
<div class="verse">Before they brought him me, and knelt beside</div>
<div class="verse">The bier, and spoke to him. He heard me not:</div>
<div class="verse">For he had gone the irremeable way,</div>
<div class="verse">Into which darkness may not penetrate</div>
<div class="verse">The voice of love, nor yearning nor desire</div>
<div class="verse">Pass its grim boundaries, but brooding wings</div>
<div class="verse">Of silence cover its eternal sleep.</div>
<div class="verse">Lost utterly! Yet still I spoke to him,</div>
<div class="verse">As if, perchance, some whisper of my voice</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Might stir the pools of silence where he lay,</div>
<div class="verse">And tremble lightly on the veils of sleep,</div>
<div class="verse">Waking some consciousness of me. Alas!</div>
<div class="verse">He was not there with me, but on the wind,</div>
<div class="verse">In every tree, his soul went wandering,</div>
<div class="verse">Through all the world dispersed. Yet still I spoke</div>
<div class="verse">Gently to him, and kissed him; till my son</div>
<div class="verse">Wept piteously by me, until tears</div>
<div class="verse">Gathered in mine own eyes and I too wept</div>
<div class="verse">In silence, by the body of my love.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“A sudden chill has struck me: do I shake?</div>
<div class="verse">I would not have this trembling of old age</div>
<div class="verse">Imputed to me as a show of fear;</div>
<div class="verse">Only the wind of dawn has chilled my blood,</div>
<div class="verse">Grown sluggish now. Death will be kind to me.</div>
<div class="verse">Does the dawn lighten? Nay, I thought the stars</div>
<div class="verse">Grew paler, but a mist was on mine eyes.</div>
<div class="verse">So long are these few hours I have to live,</div>
<div class="verse">Ere death come: yet it seems a little while</div>
<div class="verse">To those who smell the odorous warm earth,</div>

<div class="verse">But Rome herself, circled by seven hills,</div>
<div class="verse">Astride the Tiber’s fluctuating gold,</div>
<div class="verse">Though less of girth was greater than all these,</div>
<div class="verse">Not through dominion over them, but in</div>
<div class="verse">The civic sense, which quickened in her sons</div>
<div class="verse">Grave dignity, and reticence, and care:</div>
<div class="verse">Rome never bred but rulers; Rome, whose womb</div>

<div class="verse">Abrupt and cyclopean monuments</div>
<div class="verse">Of elemental anger, and beyond</div>
<div class="verse">Rose dome on dome of everlasting snow,</div>
<div class="verse">Blue glaciers, that broke the sharp white fire</div>
<div class="verse">Of dawn into a myriad flaming swords,</div>
<div class="verse">Invading the ethereal, azure sky</div>
<div class="verse">Like sudden lightning, or the wonder seen</div>
<div class="verse">By Laplanders, through the long Arctic night,</div>
<div class="verse">Illuminating, with its splendid flames,</div>
<div class="verse">The level stretches of the tideless sea.</div>

<h2>NOTE TO THE VIGIL OF BRUNHILD</h2>

<p>Brunhild was the daughter of Athanagilde, King of
the Spanish Wisigoths. The following passages from
the “Histoire de France” edited by M. Ernest Lavisse
have served as the basis of the poem.</p>

<p>“L’année même où mourut Caribert apparaissent les
deux femmes dont le nom remplit l’histoire de cette
période. Le roi Sigebert avait des mœurs plus douces
que ses frères; il n’avait point contracté comme eux
d’union avec des servantes; il rêvait de se marier avec
une fille de roi. La cour des Wisigoths d’Espagne
jetait à ce moment un vif éclat.... Sigebert envoya
une ambassade auprès du roi Athanagilde et demanda
la main de sa fille Brunehaut. Elle lui fut accordée....
Le manage fut célébré dans la ville de Metz.... Ce
mariage valut à Sigebert un grand renom, et Chilpéric
fut jaloux de son frère. Il avait épousé Andovère, dont
il avait eu trois fils: Théodebert, Mérovée et Clovis;
puis il l’avait répudiée et vivait dans la débauche,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
soumis à l’empire d’une servante, Frédégonde. Mais
après le mariage de Sigebert, il renvoya la servante, et
demanda à Athanagilde la main de sa fille aînée,
Galswinthe. Le roi de Wisigoths consentit.</p>

<p>“Un matin, on trouva Galswinthe étranglée dans son
lit. Peu de jours après le roi épousa Frédégonde....
Sigebert, pour venger sa belle-sœur, prépara la guerre.
Mais Gontran imposa sa médiation et l’on traita....
Chilpéric renonça à la possession des territoires qui
formaient le douaire de Galswinthe et les livra à Sigebert.
La guerre civile fut ainsi évitée; elle n’éclatera que six
années plus tard, en 573.</p>

<p>“Sigebert finit par être victorieux. Il entre à Paris
au mépris de la convention de 567 et y fait venir sa
femme Brunehaut, ses filles et son jeune fils Childebert;
puis il poursuit Chilpéric jusqu’à Tournai. Chilpéric
est abandonné par les grands qui proclament Sigebert
leur roi et l’élèvent sur le pavois dans la <i>villa</i> de Vitry.
Mais, pendant la cérémonie, deux esclaves réussissent à
s’approcher du triomphateur et le frappent de deux
coups de <i>scramasax</i>; dans la rainure des poignards
Frédégonde avait fait couler du poison (575).</p>

<p>“À la mort de son rival, Chilpéric retourna vers
Paris.... Le duc Gondovald réussit à sauver le fils de
Sigebert, un enfant de cinq ans: il le conduisit à Metz,
où il le fit reconnaître roi le jour de Noël; mais<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Brunehaut, et ses filles demeurèrent prisonnières; les
filles furent détenues à Meaux, Brunehaut emmenée a
Rouen.</p>

<p>“Sa beauté avait vivement frappée le fils de Chilpéric,
Mérovée; celui-ci l’avait épousée en secret et avait
favorisé sa fuite. Poursuivi par la haine implacable de
Frédégonde, Mérovée dut se faire consacrer clerc, puis
chercher un asile à Saint-Martin de Tours; finalement il
fut tué par les sicaires de la marâtre.”</p>

<p>Defeated and taken by her rebellious nobles under
Pippin and Arnulf in 613, “Brunehaut fut torturée
pendant trois jours. On l’assit en signe d’opprobre sur
un chameau et on la livra aux outrages de l’armée.
Enfin on l’attacha par les cheveux, un bras et un pied à la
queue d’un cheval, que des coups de fouet entraînèrent
en une course rapide, et bientôt son corps ne fut plus
qu’ ‘une loque informe.’” Her age, according to Guizot,
was eighty.</p>

<p>“Brunehaut en somme a été conduite toute sa vie par
une idée, et non pas exclusivement, comme la plupart
des barbares mérovingiens, par des caprices et des
passions. Elle a voulu maintenir, avec l’absolutisme
royal, les principes d’ordre et de bonne administration.”</p>

<p>Modifications in this story have been suggested by
A. Thierry’s “Récits des Temps Mérovingiens,” and
by Dean Kitchin’s “History of France.” The various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
accounts given by these authorities will justify me for an
imaginative treatment of the story; and, though I lay
claim to no historical accuracy, the story as I present it
is, probably, as near to the truth as any other version.
History is not a science: it is prophecy looking
backward, and no doubt is often as far from scientific
truth as the more conventional mode of prophecy.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
